# Crafting Limit Mod
## Features

- **Increase Craft Limit:** Craft up to 1000 items at once instead of 99.
- **Easy to Use:** No need to make permanent changesâ€”just drop the mod in your mods folder.

## Usage

- Open the crafting UI in-game.
- You can now set craft all with the amount of up to **1000** (provided you have enough materials).

## Notes

- This mod only affects the client-side limit in the crafting UI and logic. If there are server-side restrictions, those may still apply.
- If the game updates and changes the crafting logic, this mod may require an update.
