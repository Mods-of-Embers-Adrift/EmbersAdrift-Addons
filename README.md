## 🔄 Transition Notice: Moving to MelonLoader & Lua

We are looking into possibly **migrating from direct DLL replacement** to a **MelonLoader-based mod** architecture.

- ✅ **MelonLoader Integration**: Full support for modular mod loading without needing to replace `Assembly-CSharp.dll`
- ✅ **Lua Scripting Support** (via [LuaLoader](https://github.com/NeptuneQ/LuaLoader)): Allow players to script UI behavior and extensions using Lua without needing C# knowledge
- 🔧 We’ll continue updating core logic (DPS, threat, UI) in C# while exposing functionality to Lua
- 🧩 Future releases will include:
  - A Lua scripting API for custom behaviors
  - Plug-and-play `.lua` scripts
  - Backward compatibility with saved layouts and logs

> 🧠 This shift makes the addon more accessible, safer to use, and easier to extend by the community.
