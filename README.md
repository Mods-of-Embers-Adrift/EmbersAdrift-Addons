# 🌋 Embers Adrift Addons

This repository hosts **experimental UI and utility modifications** for *Embers Adrift* aimed at enhancing player experience. These tools help identify gameplay issues—such as class imbalances—and improve quality of life without fostering toxicity.

> Our mission: Help players **engage deeper** with the game through visibility, utility, and transparency.

> Moving forward with V1.3 we will only upload the new DLL with the new class updates, instead of the entire project as previously done in other versions.

> DPS Support will be re-looked at depending on Game Admins, Full support might go towards Threat Meter

## 📝 Changelogs

## 📦 Version 1.4 – Threat & DPS Enhancements

### ✨ New Features
- **Threat Tracking System:** Introduced `UserThreatTracker` to track and log threat values generated by player actions.
- **Threat Display:** Integrated percentage-based threat display, showing player's share of total threat.
- **DPS Tracking:** Added `UserDpsTracker` to record and accumulate DPS per player.
- **Combat Text Integration:** Expanded `CombatTextManager` to hook into damage events and update threat and DPS records accordingly.

### 🛠️ Enhancements
- **Filtered Threat Display:** Threat list now filters out all non-player entities. Still very early stage.
- **Local Player Check:** Ensured combat text and overhead updates are only triggered for local/valid players. Still very early stage.
- **Performance-Safe Proximity Scan:** Added `FindPlayersInRadius(Vector3, float)` to safely gather nearby players without including NPCs or invalid entities. Still very early stage.

### 🧹 Refactors & Cleanup
- Removed redundant threat/damage logging from NPC and non-player sources.
- Restructured code in `CombatTextManager.InitializeCombatText` for clearer logic separation and event handling.
- Consolidated threat and DPS registration logic to reduce duplication.
